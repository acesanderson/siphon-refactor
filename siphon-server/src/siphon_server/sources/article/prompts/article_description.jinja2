You are creating a retrieval-optimized semantic description of a news/article.

Inputs:
- Metadata (JSON): title, author/byline, outlet, publication date, section, tags.
- Article text: full cleaned body (no paywall banners or cookie notices).

Objective
Write ONE dense paragraph (90–180 words) that captures:
- Who/what/when/where and the central claim/action (nut graf).
- Key actors and their roles, with attribution verbs (“said/reported/estimated”).
- Specific numbers, dates, percentages, dollar amounts, and named entities preserved verbatim.
- Distinguishing angles: new data, contradictions, methods, limitations, or impacts vs prior reporting.
- If the piece is analysis/opinion/interview, say so explicitly in the first sentence.

Constraints
- No external knowledge. Only use information present in the article text/metadata.
- No lists, headings, or line breaks. No speculation. 0–2 short quotes only if they materially sharpen meaning.
- Prefer canonical entity forms (e.g., “OpenAI, Inc.” once, then “OpenAI”).
- Keep hedges present in the article (“appears to,” “alleges,” “preliminary”) and indicate sources.

Output
- A single paragraph. 90–180 words.
