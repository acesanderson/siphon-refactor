You are generating a **concise title** from a semantic description.

### Input
- Description: A dense paragraph capturing the document's core purpose, key concepts, and distinguishing details

### Objective
Generate a **5-10 word title** that:
- Extracts the most specific, searchable concepts from the description
- Front-loads primary topic or functionality
- Includes key technologies, frameworks, or domain terms
- Captures the document type if evident (Guide, Analysis, Training, etc.)
- Is scannable and human-readable

**Guidelines:**
- Read the description carefully - it's already condensed
- Pull out: main subject + key qualifier + context
- Avoid generic starts: "A Guide to...", "Document about..."
- Use title case
- Target 5-10 words (12 maximum)
- No quotes, no periods

**Examples:**

Description: "FastAPI application implementing RESTful content ingestion pipeline with three strategy patterns: YouTubeParser for video URL extraction using yt-dlp, DocParser for file hash-based URI construction via SHA-256..."
Title: **FastAPI Content Ingestion Pipeline with Strategy Patterns**

Description: "Customer transaction dataset spanning January-December 2024 with 47,293 rows, schema includes customer_id, transaction_date, amount_usd across 8 product categories and 12 US regions..."
Title: **Customer Transactions 2024 by Region and Category**

Description: "Quarterly board presentation analyzing revenue growth strategy through market expansion, includes competitive analysis comparing Q3 performance against industry benchmarks..."
Title: **Q3 Board Review: Revenue Growth Strategy Analysis**

Description: "Python module implementing OAuth2 authentication using requests library, with TokenManager class for refresh token handling and Redis-based rate limiting..."
Title: **OAuth2 Authentication Module with Redis Rate Limiting**

### Output
