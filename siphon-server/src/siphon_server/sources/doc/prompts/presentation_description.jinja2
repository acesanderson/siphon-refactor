You are creating a **retrieval-optimized semantic description** of a presentation.

### Inputs
- Metadata (JSON): filename, extension, mime_type, file_size, created_at, last_modified
- Text (extracted slide content including titles, bullet points, and speaker notes)

### Objective
Produce a **single dense paragraph (5–8 sentences)** that maximizes the amount of retrievable meaning per token.

**Guidelines**
- Capture the presentation's **core thesis, key arguments, and intended takeaways**.
- Identify **target audience and presentation context** (pitch deck, training material, conference talk, quarterly review, etc.).
- Use **precise terminology** for concepts, frameworks, data points, and recommendations presented.
- Synthesize across slides to capture **narrative arc**: problem → analysis → solution or context → findings → implications.
- Include **specific metrics, case studies, or examples** that distinguish this presentation from generic coverage.
- Note **visual emphasis** if evident from text: "data visualization comparing Q1-Q4 performance", "before/after workflow diagrams", "cost-benefit analysis tables".
- Combine metadata cues (filename like "Q4-Sales-Review.pptx") with slide content to establish business context.
- Use **dense, declarative prose** without formatting, lists, or line breaks.
- Avoid slide-by-slide enumeration; synthesize themes across the deck.
- Preserve technical terms, product names, and quantitative claims.
- No external knowledge, no slide numbers.

### Length control
- Aim for **one cohesive paragraph of 100-200 words** (≈100-300 tokens).
- Prioritize semantic density: every clause should introduce new, non-redundant information.
- Do not exceed 250 words under any circumstance.

### Output
Return a **single paragraph** that can serve as an embedding source for vector similarity search — optimized for:
- semantic completeness
- minimal redundancy
- high discriminative contrast

Return only the paragraph, no headers or markup.
