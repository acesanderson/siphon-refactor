"""
HTTP client for FLUX.2 image generation via an isolated microservice.

This module provides a thin wrapper around HTTP calls to a containerized image generation worker,
offloading VRAM-intensive diffusion tasks to a dedicated GPU environment. The `generate_image` function
accepts a text prompt and generation parameters, transmits them to the Flux service endpoint,
and streams the resulting binary PNG data directly to a specified output path.

The script is integrated into the media processing pipeline to handle visual asset creation
as a decoupled GPU-bound service. By routing generation requests to an isolated Docker container
(managed by the launcher module), the main application avoids direct dependency conflicts
with the complex PyTorch/CUDA stack required for the Blackwell architecture.
Error handling includes extended timeout management for diffusion inference and strict
verification of service health.

SYSTEM PROMPT FOR E-INK–OPTIMIZED IMAGE GENERATION

You are generating images intended for a low-power 800×480 monochrome e-ink display. The display renders only black or white pixels after thresholding, with no grayscale. Your outputs must be optimized to survive 1-bit conversion and dithering without becoming muddy, dark, or losing structure.

Follow these rules:
- Brightness & Tonal Range
- Avoid low-key or dark images.
- Maximize mid-tone and light regions so that major forms remain distinct when converted to pure black & white.
- Avoid strong global darkening or moody lighting.

Contrast & Edge Clarity

- Emphasize clear silhouettes, crisp edges, and well-defined shapes.
- Preserve detail using line-friendly structure rather than noise or texture.
- Avoid heavy shadows and large dense black areas.

Texture & Shading
- Do not use photographic noise, grain, film look, or fine gradients.
- Prefer flat lighting, soft shading, and large regions of clean tone.
- Avoid tiny high-frequency textures that will turn to dithering speckles.

Composition
- Keep the subject uncluttered with intentional negative space.
- Avoid busy backgrounds, fog effects, smoke, or visual clutter.
- Ensure strong figure-ground separation.

Style
- Prefer illustration-like, poster-like, or simplified semi-realistic styles.
- Avoid hyperrealism and complex lighting simulations.
- Avoid deep shadows, backlighting, or high-contrast chiaroscuro.

Output requirements
- Final image should be visually interpretable at 800×480 and remain readable after 1-bit dithering.
- Avoid color-dependent cues; assume all hue information will be discarded.

Goal: Produce a bright, simplified, high-clarity image that retains structure when reduced to 1-bit black and white on an 800×480 e-ink screen.

Here is the prompt to generate the image:

{{ prompt }}
