        <p>The astrolabe, often called the "mathematical jewel," is an intricate and elegant astronomical instrument. Originating in Hellenistic Greece and further developed in the medieval Islamic world, it served as a multifunctional analog computer. Its primary functions included solving problems related to time and the position of the Sun and stars in the sky. An astrolabe could be used to determine the time of day or night, measure the height of a celestial body, and even as a tool for astrological readings.</p>

        <p>A typical astrolabe consists of several key components: the 'mater' (mother), a hollow disc which holds the other parts; the 'tympan' or 'climate plate', engraved with a stereographic projection of a specific latitude; and the 'rete', a framework representing the ecliptic and several prominent stars. Above these sits the 'rule' or 'alidade', a rotating sight for taking measurements.</p>

        <h2>Notable Types of Astrolabes</h2>
        <ul class="instrument-list">
            <li><strong>Planispheric Astrolabe:</strong> The most common type, projecting the celestial sphere onto the plane of the equator.</li>
            <li><strong>Mariner's Astrolabe:</strong> A simplified, rugged version used by sailors to determine latitude at sea by measuring the altitude of the sun or a star.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal Astrolabe:</strong> More complex designs, such as those by al-Zarqali, that could be used at any latitude without changing plates.</li>
        </ul>
