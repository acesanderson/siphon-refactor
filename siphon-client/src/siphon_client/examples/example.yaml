  description: >
    This profile targets a mature mycelial network in a symbiotic relationship
    with a cluster of birch and pine trees. The network exhibits unusually high
    levels of electrical potential variance, suggesting complex signaling.
    Primary research objective is to decode potential pre-symbolic language patterns.
